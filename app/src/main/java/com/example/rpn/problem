Reverse polish notation calculator:

An equation written in reverse polish notation is a notation where values are pushed on to a stack,
and operators act upon the top values of the stack then push the value back on the stack.

For example:
1
would evaluate to 1
5 3 +
would evaluate to 8
5 3 3 + +
would evaluate to 11
5 3 3 + + 7 *
would evaluate to 77

Detailed breakdown of "5 3 3 + + 7 *"
5 3 3 + + 7 * : [] (stack after token is applied)
3 3 + + 7 * : [5]
3 + + 7 * : [5, 3]
+ + 7 * : [5, 3, 3]
+ 7 * : [5, 6]
7 * : [11]
* : [11, 7]
: [77]

The challenge for this dojo is to create a calculator that accepts a string of integers and
operators in RPN and returns an integer value.

Legal operators are +, -, *, / meaning addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

At the end of an equation, the result of a stack with more than one item will
be the top of the stack.

Possible extensions: additional operators (exponentiation, min/max, sqrt, general root)
